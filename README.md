**Problem Statement:**


Here is a pattern: 141592.... write a program in Erlang language that takes an integr input N and prints the above pattern upto 'N' digits.

**Approach:**


Pattern seems familiar, seen it in pi, so i've to calculate digits of pi!!

Now, there could be ways to calculate pi, got to know about Machins formula..
but it can calculate upto only 100 digits of our pattern..

**Outcome at the end:**
Successfully setuped erlang environment in my PC.
Got to learn about some algorithms to calculate pi.
